FONTLOG for Noqte
=================

Noqte: A fun, minimalistic Persian pixel font - WIP.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

I made this font in a week from scratch in order to use it in my game. The em-height is 1024 points. Each glyph is made of 64x64 points squares. There are some exceptions, sadly, mainly for designing diacritics. Those might be removed in a final version, however. For those at moment another square size is used which is 75% smaller, i.e. 32x32 points.
