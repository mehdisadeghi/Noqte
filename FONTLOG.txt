FONTLOG for Noqte
=================

Noqte: A fun, minimalistic Persian pixel font - WIP.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

I made this font in a week from scratch in order to use it in my game. The em-height is 1024 points. Each glyph is made of 64x64 points squares. There are some exceptions, sadly, mainly for designing diacritics. Those might be removed in a final version, however. For those at moment another square size is used which is 75% smaller, i.e. 32x32 points.

ChangeLog
---------

11 February 2024
- Added Arabic lookup tables for "init", "medi", "fina", and "isol"

27 January 2024
- Added a whole new set of combining diacritics including grave, accute, cedilla, circumflex, caron, tilde, ring, breve, and more
- Added the missing capital ÃŸ
- Added dotless i and j
- Added closing double quotes
- Replaced manual symbols with combined ones (improves consistency)
- Redesigned V, U, and Y.
- Switched to small dot (75x75) for almost all diacritics
- Added top/bottom anchors and marks for glyphs and diacritics
- Left positioning of diacritics to Fontforge (generated)
